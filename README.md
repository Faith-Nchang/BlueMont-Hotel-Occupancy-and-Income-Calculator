# BlueMont-Hotel-Occupancy-and-Income-Calculator
The BlueMont Hotel Occupancy and Income Calculator is a C++ program designed to assist hotel management in tracking the occupancy rates and calculating the income generated from different types of rooms in the hotel. The program prompts the user to input details about each floor of the hotel, including the number of rooms and the occupancy status of different room types. Based on this data, the program calculates the total income, the number of occupied and unoccupied rooms, and the occupancy rate.

## Features
- **Input Handling**: Collects data on the number of floors, rooms per floor, and occupancy status of various room types.
- **Validation**: Ensures that user inputs fall within specified ranges and are logically consistent.
- **Income Calculation**: Calculates the total income generated from single, double, king, and suite rooms.
- **Occupancy Analysis**: Determines the total number of occupied and unoccupied rooms and computes the occupancy rate.
- **Detailed Report**: Provides a detailed report of the hotel's occupancy status and income, including identification of the floor with the least number of rooms.
